    <li>Thanks for taking an interest in my personal site; here are some features:</li>
    <li><br></li>
    <li>>>> Simple: this site is written to get the job done and stay out of its own way. The code would probably make a real developer cry (see 'Open'), but it serves as a good reminder that most "optimization" is just "unneccessary complexity" in a pretty package.</li>
    <li>>>></li>
    <li>>>> Private: neither of us wants me using cookies, trackers, or collecting your data; so I don't. (also see 'Simple')</li>
    <li>>>></li>
    <li>>>> Open: code available on <a href="https://github.com/TimVannerson/timv-website">github</a></li>
    <li>>>></li>
    <li>>>> Web3: hosted using decentralized protocols through fleek.co</li>
    <li>>>>_</li>
