<p>
On balance, behaviors done with high intention are more effective than those performed with less thoughtfulness.
</p>

<p>
This does not only apply to high effort or high output activities; goals such as rest, recovery, personal connection also benefit from thoughtful, intentional action.

<p>
 Intention helps avoid wasted energy and unintended side effects.
