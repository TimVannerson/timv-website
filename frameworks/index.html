<p>
Whether you call them frameworks, mental models, heuristics, protocols, principles, or something else, most of us have a set of cognitive shortcuts we rely on, either consciously or otherwise.
</p>

<p>
I believe that by <a href="intention">intentionally</a> bringing awareness to our own mental models, constantly curating them, and reflecting on when/how they differ from others, we will be more effective and less conflicted in our day-to-day lives.
</p>

<p>
I also believe that being transparent about our convictions gives us the best opportunity to improve both our principles and hopefully others' as well. Have thoughts on any of these? <a href="mailto:sayhello@timvannerson.com">Drop me a note</a>! I'd love to hear from you.
