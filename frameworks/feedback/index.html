<p>
 When giving feedback, solicited or otherwise, be compassionate, consider the setting, and include positive reinforcement. The goal is to get your point across most effectively and that is dictated by how it is received, not by how we give it.

<p>
If you are coaching people, including yourself, treat them as you would a beloved friend or family member.
</p>

<p>
No one says your honesty has to be brutal.
